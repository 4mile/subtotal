# Subtotal.js

Subtotal.js is an open-source JavaScript plugin for [PivotTable.js](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable). Its originally written by [Nagarajan Chinnasamy](https://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/) at [Mindtree](http://mindtree.com/).

[PivotTable.js](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable) is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag'n'drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI and originally written in CoffeeScript by [Nicolas Kruchten](http://nicolas.kruchten.com) at [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com). 


## What does it do?

Subtotal.js renders subtotal of rows and columns of a pivot table and lets the users to expand and collpase the rows.

You can see the live demo at [examples page](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal/examples/index.html).

## How do I load the code?

Subtotal.js implements the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) pattern and so should be compatible with most approaches to script loading and dependency management: direct script loading i.e. from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable) or with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) etc. For the latter options, you can grab it from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pivottable) with `npm install pivottable` or via [Bower](http://bower.io/) with `bower install pivottable`. 

If you are loading the scripts directly (as in the [examples](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal)), you need to:

1. load the dependencies:
  1. jQuery in all cases
  2. jQueryUI for the interactive `pivotUI()` function (see below)
  3. D3.js, C3.js and/or Google Charts if you use [charting plugins](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers)
2. load the PivotTable.js files:
  1. `pivot.min.js`
3. load the Subtotal.js files:
  1. `subtotal.min.js`

(Please look at the source code of the [exmaples](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/pivottable-subtotal-renderer/blob/master/examples/subtotal_pivot.html/) 

## How do I use the code?


### `pivot()`


### `pivotUI()`

## Where is the documentation?

More extensive documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/pivottable-subtotal-renderer/wiki):


## How can I build the code and run the tests?

To install the development dependencies, just run `npm install`, which will create a `node_modules` directory with the files required to run the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build system.

After modifying any of the `.coffee` files at the top of the repo, you can compile/minify the files into the `dist` directory by running `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js`

Once that's done, you can point your browser to `tests/index.html` to run the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test suite. You can view the [current test results here](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/tests).

The easiest way to modify the code and work with the examples is to leave a `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js watch serve` command running, which will automatically compile the CoffeeScript files when they are modified and will also run a local web server you can connect to to run the tests and examples.
